The prototype design pattern is all about object copying

Complicated objects aren't designed from scratch e.g cars
	They reiterate existing designs

An existing design (partially or fully constructed) is a prototype

We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it
	Requires 'deep copy' support.

Deep copy requires copying not just an object, but you also need to copy that objects references

We also need to make the cloning convenient via Factory


Prototype: A partially or fully initialized object that you copy(clone) and make use of

ICloneable is bad, it is not the interface you should be using for deep copies

Summary:
How do you clone a prototype
	Implement your own deep copy functionality on all the objects and nested objects.
	Serialize and deserialize
