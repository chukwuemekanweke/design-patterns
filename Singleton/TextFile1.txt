Singleton Pattern

For some components it only makes sense to have one in the system
  eg Object Factory

used in cases where constructor call is expensive
    so we only do it once
    we provide everyone with the same instance

    Want to prevent anyone creating additinal copies

    need to take care of lazy instantiation and thread safety

    A singleton is a component which is instantiated only once


Singletons are difficult to test

Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depending on an abstraction (e.g an interface)

Consider defining singleton lifetime in DI container rather than hard coding one
