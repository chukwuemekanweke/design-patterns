Motivation


Want to augment an object with additional functionality
Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code (Open CLosed Principle)
Want to keep new functionality seperate (Single Responsibility Principle)
Need to be able to interact with existing structures

Build a Decorator, which simply references the decorated object(s)

Decorator: 

Facilitates the addition of behaviours to individual objects without inheriting from them
