Proxy Pattern

Same interface, entirely different behaviour

Proxy design pattern is a class that functions as an interface to particular resource. That resource may be remote, expensive to construct, or may require loggin or some other added functionality

Difference between proxy and decorator is that you don't add new members.

You add additional functionality on existing members. But you don't add new members



Property proxy
using an object as the property instead of the literal value
