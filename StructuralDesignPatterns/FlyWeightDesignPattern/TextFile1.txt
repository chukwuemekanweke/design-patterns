Fly weight design pattern

Avoid redundancy when storing data


NOTE: wiki
" String interning "
In computer science, string interning is a method of storing only one copy of each distinct string value, which must be immutable.
Interning strings makes some string processing tasks more time- or space-efficient at the cost of requiring more time when the string is created or interned.
The distinct values are stored in a string intern pool.

Flywight desing pattern is a space optimization technique that let's us use ess memory by storing externally the data associated with similar objects











Store common data externally

E.g Define the idea of 'ranges' on homogenous collections and store data related to those ranges

.NET string interning is a good example of the flyweight pattern
