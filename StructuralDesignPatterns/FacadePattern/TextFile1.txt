Facade design pattern provides a simple, easy to understand / user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code


https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/facade-design-pattern-introduction/
The facade pattern is appropriate when you have a complex system that you want to expose to clients in a simplified way, or you want to make an external communication layer over an existing system which is incompatible with the system.
Facade deals with interfaces, not implementation. 
Its purpose is to hide internal complexity behind a single interface that appears simple on the outside.
