Interpreter Pattern


Textual input needs to be processed
  E.g turned into OOP structures
Some examples
    Programming language compilers, interpreters and IDEs
    HTML, XML and similar
    Numeric expressions (3+4/5)
    Regular expressions


This design pattern is used in processing structured text data. Does so by turning it into seperate lexical tokens
and then interpreting the sequences of said tokens (parsing). 




Interpreter design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. 
Interpreter pattern is used to defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar.
This pattern involves implementing an expression interface which tells to interpret a particular context. This pattern is used in SQL parsing


Summary

An intepreter acts in 2 stages

Lexing: turns text into tokens

Parsing the tokens into meaningful constructs

Parsed data can then be traversed
