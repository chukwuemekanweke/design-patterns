The goal of the Memento pattern is to keep some form of a token, to help you return an objects state

Motivation for the Memento pattern

An object goes through changes
	e.g A bank account get deposits

There are different ways of navigating those changes

The memento patterns involves saving a snapshot of a system, that allows for roll backs 

A memento is a token/ handle representing the system state.
Allowing us to roll back to the state when the token was generated.
May or may not directly expose state information
