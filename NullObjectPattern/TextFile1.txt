Null Object pattern

When cmpnent A uses component B, it typically assumes that B is non-null

You typically don't go around putting null checks all over the place

There is no option of telling A not to use an instance if B

The Null object design pattern is 

A no-op object that conforms to the required interface, satisfying a dependency requirement of some other object
