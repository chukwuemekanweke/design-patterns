Motivation

Components may go in and out of a system at any time
	chat room participants
	players in an MMORPG

It makes no sense for them to have a direct reference to one another
	Those references may go dead


Solution: Have them all refer to some central component that facilitates communicaton


The Mediator is a component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware 
of each other or having direct (reference) access to each other


Summary

Create a mediator, and have each object in the system refer to it

Mediator engages in bi directional communication with it's connected components

Mediator has functions the components can call

Components have functions the mediator can call

We use reactive extensions libraries which make the communication easier to implement
